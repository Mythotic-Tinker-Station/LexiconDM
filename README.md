# LexiconDM
LexiconDM is similar to base Lexicon, however, LexiconDM's focus is on compiling the ultimate collection of Doom Deathmatch mapsets to be played online with full support of all competitive game modes (Deathmatch/Duel/etc). The target source port is Zandronum, but LexiconDM will happily work on (G)ZDoom and other source ports based off of recent versions in the ZDoom family. LexiconDM should also work with all major gameplay mods (Samsara: Reincarnation & Insanity Deathmatch, to name two).

## How do I build the PK3?
Compile.bat will build the project. Run Compile.bat and select Option 3, then it will build the PK3 for you and allow you to quickly test LexiconDM using your source port of choice.

## How/Where can I play this?
You can download it right here in our downloads section, or get it through your favorite WAD repo (also through Doomseeker/WADseeker/etc). You can also play locally with bots utilizing offline skirmish mode within Zandronum.

You can also compile a build yourself from the above instructions, though builds compiled this way will be considered bleeding edge as many elements may be unfinished and/or unstable.

## How can I get involved with this project?

If one compiles a build per the instructions and you would be interested in filing bug reports, please feel free to do so, as this would greatly help with LexiconDM's development. You may file bug reports here, or within The Mythotic Tinker-Station Discord, along with any mapset requests.

If one is interested in becoming a beta tester and/or wishes to help with development, please get in touch (include coding knowledge/skills/etc if wanting to assist development) with meleemario via The Mythotic Tinker-Station Discord or through Direct Message.
