# LexiconDM
This project is similar to Lexicon, in that it's a collection of maps made for Doom II: Hell on Earth and The Ultimate Doom. However, LexiconDM contains multiplayer maps with the purpose of deathmatches, duals, and other competitive gamemodes supported by the ZDoom source port. Although Zandronum is the target source port, LexiconDM will be playable on ZDoom, GZDoom, and other source ports built off of recent versions of ZDoom.

## How to build the pk3?
Although there are two .bat files that will build the project, it's recommended that you use CompilePK3-Jenkins.bat. It will automatically build the file for you and allow you to quickly test out the project using your launcher of choice.

## Where can I play this?
For now, the only way to play LexiconDM is to build the file and play with bots.
