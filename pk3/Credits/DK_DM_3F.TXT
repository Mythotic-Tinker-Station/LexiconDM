Description		: Greetings Deathmatch fanatics! I've slaved over Doom Builder yet again and constructed 12 more deathmatch maps for some fun fresh fragging. These ones are a bit different than my older maps, I went in with the goal of creating some really powerful, replayable layouts. The better you know the turf, the better you'll do in game - There are lots of secrets and hidden bonuses.

There are also 20 of my older maps included, with various bugfixes (texturing glitches, VPOs, areas the player could get stuck, etc. have all been eradicated) and other layout improvements as well, which really makes some of them feel complete in areas that were a little half-baked.

As always, I really hope you enjoy them! Feedback is always appreciated!

//Here's a little re-cap for the upcoming DWANGO20 compilation:
What I've done is collected 30 of the best DM maps from /idgames made between 1994-1998 (the lifespan of DWANGO) and compiled them into one big mapset in that old DWANGO tradition. Of course, all of these maps give permission for reuse, and I'll include all accompanying .txt files. I was surprised by the quality of each of these maps, and the attention to strategy paid by the authors. Very stand-out stuff from the old days, the cream of the 90's DM crop. The 20th anniversary is Dec. 11 2014, and that's the planned release date. Stay tuned :)

Credits			: Thanks to Mr. Crispy, Doomguy93, Sparklebunny, Psyych and everyone else at Odamex, Zdaemon and Zandronum who playtested. Also a big shoutout to people who found the major camping spots/other MASSIVE troll areas in the oldie maps. Because of you, the maps are now improved!
