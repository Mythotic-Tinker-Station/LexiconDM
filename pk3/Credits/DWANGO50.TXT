Description             : This compiles my 50 favorite Dwango maps into one
                          easy wad. Some MIDI files were all messed up in the
                          original Dwango wads - I have fixed any sloppy
                          or broken MIDIs in this version. I've also fixed a
                          few missing textures and other various mapping
                          errors. Includes MAPINFO for zdoom-based ports!
                          
                          This pack features maps from:
