Description             : Hello again DM lovers! Here I have 12 maps I whipped up fairly quickly that are sure to please. Serious matches can be had with 2-4 players, but it goes insane with 8+! I have made the BFG optional, because I know a lot of people don't like it (see: whining). Select Skill 1/2 for Soulsphere, 3 for Invisibility sphere, and 4/5 for the BFG - It's the best option, of course!

I took a different approach with map08 and map12, they both use a more narutal layout. You'll know what I mean when you play them! (Sadly they cause VPOs in vanilla.) There's a secret with the Coke machine in the mall, map07. Originally there was only a Pepsi machine, but Ralphis reminded me that Pepsi sucks - it really does - so I added a Coke machine and moved the secret to it instead!

As always, enjoy the frags! I welcome any feedback/criticism.

Additional Credits to   : Mr.Crispy, the_miano, DevilutioN, Ralphis, Hex, Cato and a bunch of other Doomers for testing. Frag on, brothers. Also, thanks to TheAwesomePanda for some MIDI files!
