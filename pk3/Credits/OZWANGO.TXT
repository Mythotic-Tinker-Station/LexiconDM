Notes
#1 Fptemple:
The sides of the bridge are lifts so you won't get stuck!
#2 Quik:
To get the soul sphere strafe running is needed!
#3 Tower:
To get the plasma strafe running is NOT required.....only balance!
#4 King:
The blue skull switch on the pillar near the beserk pulls down the lift....
run fast to get the sphere. The switch up there opens up the exit doors and
a whole new room! The exit is on the cyberdemons throne.
#5 BFG Goose:
For the BFG gooses of the world who think 'the bfg is a thinking man's weapon'
this is dedicated to you losers, courtesy of Griz.
#6 Dare2run:
The Mega Sphere is impossible to get unless u have the 1% armour :). You will
reach the sphere with 1% health left and be able to get back out with 140% if u
use strafe run :)


This WAD is to the best of our knowledge compiled with OZ ONLY wads. Sorry 
for any WADS that arent Australian appearing but we had no TXT files and could 
not determine their origin.

The main purpose for making this compilation was to show all the DOOMSTERS in
the world what DEATHMATCH players should demand in a compilation. After 
downloading the recent DWANGO6.WAD and playing through it we saw how fuking 
shit half the levels were for deathmatch and experienced over 3 level 1 edits
and levels that had no exits. So i decided to put together 30 levels which r
all original and only the best playing levels were included. We playtested this 
on a 4 computer network and then played DWANGO6.WAD....then we deleted DWANGO
and started playing OZWANGO.WAD again. 

Peace out
